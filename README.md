This repository contains the dockerfile to create an image with [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) and the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) installed


The main use for this is to ready-bake the installation so that we can run our Pulumi projects against Azure

Currently, this image is hosted on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/scottam/az-pulumi)

## Prerequisites
